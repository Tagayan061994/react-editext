# CONTRIBUTING

I don't have too many rules for the contribution.

The only thing is that we follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) guide here.

So please, try to stick to those rules.

If you fix something:

> fix: bla bla bla

If it is not code related, like some deps update or documentation change:

> chore: update docs

If it is a new feature:

> feat: implement that awesome feature

If you don't know about conventional commits, PLEASE read [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

Thanks.
